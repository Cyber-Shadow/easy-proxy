# easy-det-nsw-proxy
**Disclaimer: This is NOT a script that circumvents the school internet, it simply connects to proxy.det.nsw.edu.au in the terminal, allowing bash commands to connect to the internet. Sorry for the confusion.**
 
A script made for linux noobies, sets and removes the school proxy for the terminal/bash. Requires authentication.


Executing the file:

    sh /path/to/file/easyproxy

-or-

    chmod +x /path/to/file/easyproxy

    /path/to/file/easyproxy
